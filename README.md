This is simple cross-platform OpenGL 2 demo. It successfully builds both on Windows platform (Visual Studio 2017, Code::Blocks 17.12), and on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian distro).
Built program will display rotating triangle on screen. It uses the fact OpenGL 2 ES is very simmilar to OpenGL 2 and both may use nearly the same shader programs.
